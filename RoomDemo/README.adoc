= RoomDemo

_Room_ is Google's "new" Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for Android,
which introduces what Android Database Handling should have been 10-15 years ago.
Well, it's finally here. It has the capabilities of JPA/Hibernate + DeltaSpike Data (and Spring
Persistence?).

You just annotate your entity classes, write your DAO as an annotated _interface_, run the
Annotation Processor in your Gradle build, and use the DAO! The DAO impl class is generated
by the APT, transparently.

== Status

This version of this project compiles and runs but doesn't appear to save
the data. Work In Progress! But important enought to get out here now.
